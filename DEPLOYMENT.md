6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub
```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial website commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

### Step 2: Configure DNS
For GitHub Pages:
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update your domain's DNS settings:

## Option 5: Local Testing

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)

php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Deployment Path

**For Erum's website, I recommend:**

1. **Start with GitHub Pages** (free, professional, easy to update)
2. **Add a custom domain** later if desired
3. **Consider Netlify** if you want more features

### Quick GitHub Pages Setup:

```bash
# Run these commands in your terminal:
